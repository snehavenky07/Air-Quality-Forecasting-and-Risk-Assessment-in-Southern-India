# Air-Quality-Forecasting-and-Risk-Assessment-in-Southern-India

Air pollution poses severe health and environmental risks, particularly in urban and industrialized regions. This project focused on forecasting Air Quality Index (AQI) levels for five southern Indian states using advanced time series models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Prophet. By integrating meteorological and demographic data, the project aimed to provide actionable insights to policymakers to mitigate air pollution risks, protect public health, and support sustainable environmental practices.
